# Introduction

## :trophy: A3.4 Learning Activity
Project documentation using the Scrum framework for the planning and estimation phase.

### :blue_book: Instructions

* Based on an investigation and the provided document by the teacher, realize the documentation for the project using scrum framework for the case study.

* The activity must be realized using a platform like **Notion**, or **Confluence**, and must be send in PDF style, named with the nomenclature **A3.3_ActivityName_StudentName.pdf**

* Your repository, besides containing a **readme**.md inside the root directory containing student's information, team, subject, career, teacher's information, and also a logo or pictures, must contain a section of contents or index.

## :pencil2: Development
1. Join your work team and start preparing what is requested below:
* 1.1 Identify the tasks for each user story.
* 1.2 Estimate the tasks using a digital tool.
* 1.3 Create the Sprint backlog with the tasks estimated in hours.
* 1.4 Create your gantt chart.
* 1.5 Identify the dependencies of each task and relate it to the activity it depends on.
* 1.6 Prepare the Burn down chart of the sprint.

2. Present this information making use of visual and graphic tools within the meeting of sprint planning.

* Sprint Back log

## :paperclip: Conclusions

> Cesar Arredondo Bonilla
>
> In this activity I focused on the activities that would be carried out to achieve the first spring of the project. For this we met and first we discussed what stories could be in the first spring, to which we came to the conclusion that the start of the session and the creation of topics would be presented first. Once selected, we proceeded to create the necessary activities to complete each story, as well as assign it to a member of the team. Since we had all the activities, the voting was made of the time from 2 to 8 hours that each person thought that it would take with each activity in order to obtain an estimate. Then we elaborated the Gantt chart and with the support of the previous one we managed to develop it, although it took us some time because they had to relate to the hours that each person would work per day, not passing 8 hours.

> The practice mainly consisted in the first sprint of our project, in which the activities are created depending on the user stories, in which a person in charge is needed and an estimate of time in hours of work to be carried out, to estimate them we use planning poker to facilitate this process and managers were chosen based on their skills. After the Gannt schedule is created, which details the weeks in which the activities will be carried out, after that based on that we can fill the working hours for 10 days of sprint to perform the burn down graph which indicates us If we go well in the hours worked, both the ideal and the real ones. This practice helps us learn to use the sprint and how each of its activities are composed, having the template it is easy to make the burn down graph, but to dictate the activities you have to think about every detail that can be done, in addition to To fill in the working hours, even as an example, you need to calculate well which activities can be carried out at the same time or advance them and which ones not, so you have to carry a bit of logic when creating the gantt diagram and filling in the sprint of hours worked.

> In this activity, what was the creation of a sprint of the first activities to be carried out in the project was elaborated. Seeing the user stories we identify which ones will be developed in the first sprint of the project. Once identified, we break down into several tasks that must be developed so that they can be fulfilled. When all the tasks were declared, the team got together and an online tool was used to determine the hours it would take us to complete the tasks. Based on the times we estimate, we organize how we will distribute these times over 10 days and each day you can only work 8 hours. When the time distribution was finished, the Gantt chart began to be made, where the tasks to be carried out were inserted and a dependencies column was placed where it is declared which tasks depend on others, this means that several activities cannot start on the first day. With the Gantt we saw how all the tasks are distributed in days and it was possible to see that several can be done in parallel and finished at the same time, making the first sprint can be finished in 7 days if everything is done in the established time.

>For this activity, we established the work sprints according to the scrum methodology based on user stories. We used the planning poker tool so that each user gave an approximate number of hours a user story would require. Then we assign the tasks to each member equally and write it down in the document. With a gantt chart we set the schedules correctly since there are user stories that depend on others having been previously completed. With the diagram, we were able to visually identify that several user stories can be developed while working on others, in this way each member can work somewhere. In the end, all user stories were completed within ten days. The practice and the tools used were very helpful to finish understanding the scrum framework and how sprints are applied.
