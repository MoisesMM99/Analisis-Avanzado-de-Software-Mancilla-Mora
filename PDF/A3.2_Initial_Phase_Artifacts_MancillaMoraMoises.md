# Project Beginning

## :trophy: A3.2 Class Challenge
Initial phase of the SCRUM framework for the case study.

### :blue_book: Instructions

* Based on an investigation and the provided document by the teacher, realize the documentation for the project using scrum framework for the case study.

* The activity must be realized using a platform like **Notion**, or **Confluence**, and must be send in PDF style, named with the nomenclature **A3.2_ActivityName_StudentName.pdf**

* Your repository, besides containing a **readme**.md inside the root directory containing student's information, team, subject, career, teacher's information, and also a logo or pictures, must contain a section of contents or index.

## :pencil2: Development

1. Join with your work team and begin to prepare what is said below:
    - 1.1 Create a scrum board with the columns to-do, doing, review, done.
    - 1.2 Realize the backlog epics for the product.
    - 1.3 Elaborate the user stories for each epic.
    - 1.4 Place every epic and user story inside the scrum board.
    - 1.5 Prioritize and estimate each user story using a tool.

2. Present this information during the planning meeting, using visual and graphics tools which can be through any online platform.

## :paperclip: Conclusions

> Cesar Arredondo Bonilla
>
> In this practice it was possible to understand how the epics are developed for the Scrum start-up process, which at first were a bit difficult to understand, what we decided to do is create epics on the main points of the project and with these develop user stories. In addition to filling in the estimation column, we used the platform seen in class and we used the average that was returned, but before each epic we made a description so that the whole team understood the epic and voted correctly. Regarding the priority column, this was done using the Moscow methodology, and finally it was decided to create the Scrum Board in Miro, and all the user stories were placed with the activities that we consider necessary for them.

>In this activity, the first part of SCRUM It has been made in which sub-activities related to the project of case study two were carried out, the first was the document that is based on the epics and user histories of which we based on the requirements of high level and from there they are broken down into simpler things for user stories, it also has to prioritize for which the MoSCoW method was used, and for the estimation the online application of Planning poker was used. After completing the document, the stories were passed to a scrum board and arranged in the to-do column. In a matter of this practice, it helps us to realize the activities and sub-activities that we have to do and which are the most important for the client and which must or should not be in addition to knowing how much it will cost us to do it, it is a good document so that the team is aware of the things to do about the project and make them clear before starting it

> In this work, one of the first activities carried out in the SCRUM was developed. The first thing that was done was the document where the epics and user stories are described, where important points of the project that must be taken into consideration are described. Each epic was divided into several user stories where the functions that users need were described and for what, where we were able to find out what criteria they must meet. During this part of the activity, the criteria had to be assigned a priority level where the development team evaluated the priority of each criterion thanks to the help of a Scrum Board where it was possible to see what was necessary to carry out the criterion. In the estimation column, it was inserted how long it would take in each criterion to elaborate and complete it, for that a tool mentioned in class was used where the team joined so that each one could vote for how long a specific criterion would take and take the average of the voting. During the development of this activity it was possible to see and understand all the activities and necessary requirements to be carried out for the project, it also helps us to understand especially the requirements that customers need.

>In my opinion, it has been one of the most productive and entertaining practices to do due to all the steps taken and the communication of the team members. The practice consisted of fully defining the entire scrum framework, appropriately posing and documenting epics and points of interest about the project. Also using different very productive tools such as miro or confluence, the files were made and I learned to use these important tools. As a team, we ended up establishing the estimated work time using another tool and everything was captured efficiently.
